# dynamics-moment-free-motion

Contains a moment free motion of a rigid body visualization code for illustrations of geodesic paths and rotation parameterization using quaternions (or Euler parameters).

Users can visualize an animation of a rectangular body subject to initial conditions governing mass center position, mass center velocity, rigid body orientation, and angular velocity.
